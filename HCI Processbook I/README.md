# HCI Processbook I
 

## Introduction
Web applications are services or products that users can access over the Internet in a platform-independent manner, where the web-browser is the medium for interaction. Web applications can be found on a tablet, mobile, network, laptop, or desktop platform.

 

Some examples of web applications include photo sharing websites, task management applications, social networking, blogging, online shopping, etc.

 

The goal of the project is to practice the methods taught in CS 570 and apply them in the context of a real-world problem of your choosing. This project will practice following a design process, working with a team, and learning more about the problem domain of web applications.

 

## Stage 1: Understanding

The first step of this project is to identify and understand potential users regarding your problem area through survey of relevant literature and user research. You have completed this step as a part of Assignment 1. Save your outputs here for your Processbook!

 

## Stage 2: Brainstorm and Build

Now that you have gone through the process of understanding how people do their “work”, the next stage is acting on what you learned! Your first step is brainstorming! We brainstorm to generate as many possible approaches as we can to supporting the task you focused on for your contextual inquiry. Generate lots of ideas! We have provided some resources for how to get started brainstorming on Canvas. When brainstorming, keep in mind user needs and ideas on how to meet those needs.

 

After you have reached saturation in your brainstorming, begin narrowing what you’re going to focus on building! Explore the space of your brainstorming, and settle on your intended approach. At this stage you should begin sketching your interface. These sketches are low-cost and low-fidelity, on purpose. This allows you and your team to iterate quickly as you begin designing your interface.

 

You will present your the conclusions of your contextual inquiry and brainstorming, and your interim sketches in class for your interim presentation. This should be 3 minutes long, and should be submitted as a recorded presentation on Canvas. The goal here is to highlight your conclusions from your contextual inquiry, what conclusions you drew based on your brainstorming what your team decided on, how you’ve reflected this in your story board, and your current ideas in sketch form.

 

After your presentation, begin prototyping your interface in Figma. You need to complete this stage before beginning your evaluation phase!

 

## Stage 3: Evaluation

After a prototype has been created, it is important in any design process to evaluate the idea. Your team will evaluate your project by conducting a usability test. Specify 2-3 tasks, informed by your contexual inquiry process that you’ve designed your interface to support, and prepare a usability test protocol. Run your usability test with 3 people, through each of your tasks, and have them perform a TAP.

 

To finish off the project, your team will present their final design, a working or simulated prototype, and the results from the user evaluation for the final presentation. You will also submit a Processbook, summarizing your whole process from start to finish, and providing examples throughout.
