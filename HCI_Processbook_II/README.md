# HCI Processbook II

## Introduction
Embodied interaction, broadly, is interaction between computataional technology and the human
body. This can mean any number of things, robotic interactions, voice assistant interactions,
wearables, VR/AR, among others! Importantly, it means not desktop or laptop applications, and
not smartphone or tablet touchscreen applications. These interactions (and the associated
technology) are more environmental, and need to account for more complex and social
interactions.
The goal of the project is to practice the methods taught in CS 570 and apply to designing a new
type of embodied interaction, in the context of a real-world problem of your choosing. This
project will practice following a design process, working with a team, and learning more about
the problem domain of embodied interactions. Importantly, rather than using Figma (since we’re
not focused on traditional screens), your prototyping here is in the form of a video prototype, in
which you depict the embodied interaction through a video scenario.

## Stage 1: Understanding
The first step of this project is to identify and understand a setting and an activity through a
design ethnography. Choose these based on the kinds of settings you’re envisioning your
prototype applying to. You will complete this step as a part of Assignment 3. Save your outputs
here for your Processbook!
You will present the outcomes and findings of your design ethnography in your interim
presentation, which will be submitted as a recording on canvas. Aim for this to be 3 minutes
long, and no longer than 3.5 minutes. Please highlight (1) your setting and activity from the
design ethnography, (2) your process of conducting a design ethnography, and (3) what your
design ethnography suggests as design opportunities.


## Stage 2: Brainstorm and Build
Now that you have gone through the design ethnography process, generating ideas and initial
prototypes of your embodied interaction, based on what you learned! Your first step is generate
prototype ideas for your video prototype, through a combination of sketches, and scenarios
(note: these are low-fidelity approaches).
Your second step, after you have worked out these early concepts, is to get slightly higher-
fidelity, and develop story boards and a script for your video prototype, as well as user personas
and design vignettes. These will let you start constructing the “plot” of your video prototype.


## Stage 3: Design
Construct your video prototype! Please don’t hesitate to reach out to Student Technology
Services and other video creation pointers we provide on canvas. Your goal here is a 3-minute
prototype of the technology and the interaction you designed! This is your final presentation
and final prototype.
To finish off the project, your team will submit a Processbook, summarizing your whole process
from start to finish, and providing examples throughout.
